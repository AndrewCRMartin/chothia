15 residue CDR-L1 class is missing from data files!

This CDR L1 region is 15 amino acids (kabat L24 to L34, which is
matching the cdr L1 region in bold). In the Chothia paper (Al-Lazikani
B., Lesk A.M., Chothia C. (1997). Standard conformations for the
canonical structures of immunoglobulins. J Mol Biol. 273(4):927-48.),
CDR L1 with 15 AA are defined as class 5 CDR.  WAM result indicates
class 8, corresponding to a 15 AA sequence, corresponding to the class
k5 (Whitelegg N., Rees A.R. (2004).  Antibody variable Regions
